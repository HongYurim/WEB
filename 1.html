    <h2>love</h2>
    <strong>Drunk on <u>love</u></strong> just hoping we can make it
    We’re all living in the moment
    We’re all living for the high
    Like there’s nothing wrong about us
    But we’re barely getting by
    And we don’t know why we do what do
    But we have to try even if we loose
    Cause I’d rather die than admit I knew any better, knew any better
    Cause it’s not hard for us to say we’ll live forever
    But none of us have got it all together

    Everybody’s got a secret
    Something that we need to hide
    Saying that you’ll do it different
    You don’t need to justify
    And we don’t know why we do what do
    But we have to try even if we loose
